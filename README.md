IMDB provides a list of celebrities born on the current date. Below is the link: http://m.imdb.com/feature/bornondate

Get the list of these celebrities from this webpage using web scraping (the ones that are displayed i.e top 10). You have to extract the below information:

  1. Name of the celebrity
